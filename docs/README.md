## Synopsis
For approximation, the initial data must be found in which there will be a table with x and y and the approximating function is selected. 

The program considers the coefficients of the approximating function. It calculates the starting point, which has the maximum deviation from the resulting graph, exclude this point and recount again. 

As a result, a graph should be drawn, on which the starting points, the first graph, the second graph are drawn. The coefficients of the approximating function calculated two times must also be displayed.
